# javademos
This repository contains Java-related demonstrations typically discussed in greater detail on the "Inspired by Actual Events" blog (http://marxsoftware.blogspot.com/). These are miscellaneous demonstrations of using Java in different contexts. These demonstrations are not intended to be used as-is with their intended purpose being demonstration rather than direct utility. Therefore, these examples are not necessarily designed or tested for production use.

Here are the blog posts associated with these demonstrative examples:
